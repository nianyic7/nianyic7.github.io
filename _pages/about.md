I am a PhD student in the Physics Department at Carnegie Mellon University, co-advised by Hy Trac and Tiziana Di Matteo. My PhD research focuses broadly on numerical simulations in astrophysics, mainly on topics related to galaxy formation, super-massive black hole binaries, gravitational waves, and cosmic reionization. 

Before joining CMU, I graduated with an B.A. in Physics and Math from the University of Chicago, USA, where I worked with Scott Dodelson on compression algorithms for extracting maximum information from cosmic shear data in the [Dark Energy Survey](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/), and with Bradford Benson on comparing mass proxies for galaxy clusters in the [South Pole Telescope](https://pole.uchicago.edu/public/Home.html).
